# 4DsequenceTimeAlignment
Algorithm to temporarily align two 4D sequences

Put the 2 sequences in the same path as the code, and name them A.bvh and B.bvh
Just write <python3 run.py> and then result sequence named C.bvh will be generated. 

There are 2 examples of BVH files, already named A.bvh and B.bvh
Just in case you dont have examples files and want to try improve this code.
